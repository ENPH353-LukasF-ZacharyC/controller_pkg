#Lab1
- Getting Linux installed

#Lab2
- Edited an image to put a red dot on a line
- Took video frame by frame and edited each one
- Found the line by finding the midpoint by examing each pixel in a cropped section
- Doesn't seem very efficient
- Better solutions might be center of mass or line finding functions

#Lab3
- Implemented a line following robot
- Followed the line using the Lab2 method
- Same efficiency issue need to find a better way

#Lab4
- Created a program that could find a given object from a video feed
- Was really effective would like to play around with it's abilities
- Could use to find license plates
- If you could cycle through all the needed licenses plates and look for them fast enough could work

#Lab5
- Used machine learning to create a program that could determine the letters and numbers on a license plate
- Very effective
- In combonation with Lab4 could be the way we find and identify license plates

#Lab6
- Used machine learning by Q values to make a robot follow a line
- Fairly effective
- Robot learned slowly but successfully completed a lap
- Need to look more into loading and storing pickle data
- May not be the best method for competition
